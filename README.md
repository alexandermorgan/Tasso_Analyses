This repo contains Tasso compositions with cadential analysis included. This is a work in progress and my working cadential definitions for this repertoire may change. The cadences are labeled in blue under the score in lieu of the text of the lowest part.

## Cadential Observations about this Style

This style's approach to cadences is characterized by a rich pallet of techniques to diminish the rhetorical weight of cadences. Despite having frequent cadential events, almost all of the cadences are adulterated in some way to maintain a lighter flow in the musical syntax. While cadential evasion and abandonment had already been in use for well over a century, this style elevates those techniques to a new level of refinement and sophistication.

The following techniques have been observed serving to lessen the rhetorical weight of cadences:

- evasion and/or abandonment of one or more voices participating in a cadence
- weak metric placement of the cadential arrival
- voice transfers in cadential voice functions
- new attacks very soon after the cadential arrival
- overlapping imitation and phrase ellision
- suspensionless cadences
- purely ornamental suspensions at the end of a piece or section
- greater preference for thirds in arrival sonorities, even if it requires cadential evasion to achieve

While less-common, a few techniques that increase the weight of cadences include:

- fauxbourdon or fauxbourdon-like passages leading up to a cadence
- homorhythm in all or most active voices
- phrasal repetition
- durational emphasis of an arrival chord
- one or more voices participating in a cadence resting immediately afterwards
- lining up of the text and cadence structures
- double cadences (to a pitch and then the pitch a 5th lower)
- suspensionless emphasis of perfect intervals (often without 3rds)
